# Leetcode_doubts
A repository for the doubts i encountered and will encounter while solving LC problems

This repository documents the doubts in LC that i most commomly have 
Please note the following:
1. This repository will not be public all the time.
2. It will only be made public when i encounter a doubt i can't seem to resolve even after looking through the solution
3. I will try to structure the doubts topicwise to the best of my abilities so that if i decide to make it public in the future, it is easy to navigate
